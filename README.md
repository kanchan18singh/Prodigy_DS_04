# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data(Twitter)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, we can categorize social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and visualize these patterns to understand the overall sentiment landscape.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for sentiment analysis
- Twitter data (in CSV format or any other supported format)



## Usage
1. Prepare your social media data:
   - Ensure your social media data is in CSV format or convert it to CSV if it's in a different format.
   - Make sure your data contains columns for the text of the social media posts and any relevant metadata (e.g., timestamps, user IDs, brands/topics).
2. Update the file paths and column names in the provided Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the notebook/script to perform sentiment analysis and visualization:
4. Explore the generated visualizations and analyze the sentiment patterns in your social media data.
